# Mathematical_Olympiad
The goal of this project is to create algorithms and models that can solve tricky math problems written in LaTeX format. This will help to advance AI modelsâ€™ mathematical reasoning skills and drive frontier knowledge.

## Getting Started
1. Programming Language: Python.
2. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn.
3. Framework: Jupyter Notebook.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The histogram above shows the distribution of answers in the dataset. It appears that the answers are spread over a range of values, with some clustering around certain values. This could indicate a variety of difficulty levels or types of problems.

## Machine Learning
1. Feature Engineering: Extract features from the problem text, such as the presence of certain keywords or mathematical symbols.
2. Model Choice: Given the complexity and likely non-linear relationships, a model like a decision tree or more sophisticated model like a random forest might be suitable for initial experiments.
3. Training the Model: Train the model on the engineered features.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

mean-squared error approximately 69247.15

After using Vectoriser, mean-squared error reduced approximately 26565.38
This is an improvement, hence demonstrating the potential of more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques in capturing relevant information from the text.
